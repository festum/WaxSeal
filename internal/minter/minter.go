// can happen under mintMu (see sessionDied). That is not a proof failure: the
// dead page says nothing about whether the session could stream, so it is
// neither recorded against the cool-down nor allowed to spend the streak's
// relaunch. The request takes the replacement ensure publishes and proves that
// instead, once; a replacement that dies too is refused, and the next request
// relaunches.
//
// A bot check is not a proof failure at all: the identity is walled, not the
// session's ability to stream, so waiting cannot lift it and a fresh identity
// can. It relaunches at once rather than taking the first-failure step, at most

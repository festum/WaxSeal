# WaxSeal

WaxSeal is a YouTube **PO Token (POT)** provider that runs Google's BotGuard in
a real headless Chromium, driven over the Chrome DevTools Protocol by a
repository-local standard-library client. It ships a bgutil-compatible HTTP
daemon, a CLI, and reusable Go clients.

A real browser lets BotGuard inspect the actual navigator and reliably produce
tokens with the **integrity** grade.

> The container image bundles Chromium. To run the Go binary directly instead,
> the host needs a system Chromium (auto-detected; set `WAXSEAL_CHROME_BIN` to
> override), since the binary is not self-contained.

## Quick start

WaxSeal usually runs as a container (example compose file found in repo), and
the published image bundles Chromium, so the host needs only Docker:

```sh
docker compose up -d  # pulls ghcr.io/colespringer/waxseal and starts on 127.0.0.1:4416
```

That pulls the `:latest` tag; pin a release with `WAXSEAL_VERSION`, for example
`WAXSEAL_VERSION=1.0.0 docker compose up -d`. To build the image from source instead
of pulling, run `make docker-build` first; it tags the same name locally.

The image is published for linux/amd64 and linux/arm64. The plain tag
(`:latest`, `:1.0.0`) is a manifest covering both, so Docker resolves the right
one; the per-architecture tags it is assembled from (`:1.0.0-amd64`,
`:1.0.0-arm64`) stay pullable for pinning one platform.

Each release's binaries and image tags, the multi-arch tag and the
per-architecture ones alike, carry a GitHub build provenance attestation naming
the commit and workflow run that built them. `gh attestation verify
oci://ghcr.io/colespringer/waxseal:1.0.0 --repo ColeSpringer/WaxSeal` checks a
pulled image against it, and `gh attestation verify <binary> --repo
ColeSpringer/WaxSeal` a downloaded binary.

The container is ready when its healthcheck passes. The daemon binds its socket
before browser startup but serves only once `/ping` returns `{"ok":true,...}`;
startup attests the first tenant, caches a GVS token, and runs a full-length
streaming proof, usually 10-30 seconds. A mint failure stops startup; a failed
streaming proof is logged and retried by `/player-context` or `/session`. Once
ready, call the API:

```sh
curl -s localhost:4416/get_pot -d '{"content_binding":"<video_id>"}'
curl -s localhost:4416/session
curl -s localhost:4416/player-context -d '{"video_id":"<video_id>"}'
curl -s localhost:4416/ping
curl -s localhost:4416/metrics
```

### Running with a consumer

A PO token is bound to the minting host's egress IP, so a consumer that fetches
media must egress the same IP as WaxSeal. `compose.full.yaml` runs the daemon and
a consumer in one network namespace to guarantee that; point `CONSUMER_IMAGE` at
your application, and the daemon stays unpublished:

```sh
CONSUMER_IMAGE=your/image:tag docker compose -f compose.full.yaml up
```

Both `compose.yaml` (standalone) and `compose.full.yaml` extend the shared,
hardened `compose.base.yaml`; see those files for the read-only, resource-limit,
and multi-tenant options. Publishing beyond loopback requires API keys, described
under [Authentication and tenants](#authentication-and-tenants).

### From source

Build and run without Docker, on Linux, macOS, or Windows. This path needs Go and
a system Chromium or Chrome:

```sh
go build ./...
go run ./cmd/waxseal server   # start the daemon on 127.0.0.1:4416
```

The CLI also runs one-shot commands, each against a fresh browser:

```sh
go run ./cmd/waxseal -c <content_binding>       # one-shot token
go run ./cmd/waxseal player-context <video_id>  # one-shot streaming context
go run ./cmd/waxseal doctor                     # report identity and token grade
go run ./cmd/waxseal ping                       # check a running daemon
```

Prefer the warm daemon for repeated requests. Commands that take `--video` want a
bare video ID, not a URL. The one-shot `player-context` prints the same object the
endpoint returns, minus `session_generation`: there is no daemon session to report.

`doctor` can also stop short of the full check. `--skip-attest` reports the
captured identity without attesting, leaving the `attest` key out of the report
rather than showing an empty grade. `--stop-after-load` stops earlier still, at
the load event of a page the command serves to itself on loopback, so it verifies
that Chromium renders and navigates with no external network at all;
`--landing-url` aims that check at some other page. Neither combines with
`--full`, which needs an attested session. The container image is smoke-tested
with `waxseal doctor --stop-after-load` on an isolated network, and `make
docker-build docker-smoke` runs the same check locally.

On Windows, Chrome or a Chromium build is auto-detected under Program Files and
the per-user install directory (`WAXSEAL_CHROME_BIN` overrides it, and Edge is never picked up on its
own because it reports a different browser identity), browser profiles live under
`%TEMP%`, and Ctrl-C stops the daemon the same way it does elsewhere. The
container remains the recommended deployment on every host.

## HTTP API

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/get_pot` | Mint or retrieve a cached PO token |
| `GET`, `POST` | `/player-context` | Return an attested streaming context |
| `GET` | `/session` | Export the attested guest identity and cookies |
| `POST` | `/report` | Report a degraded stream and recycle its session |
| `GET` | `/ping` | Health of the tenant's session, or of the shared browser when a keyed daemon gets no key |
| `GET` | `/metrics` | Operational counters; keyed daemons redact tenant detail |

Tokens and exported identities are bound to the minting host's egress IP, so the
consumer must issue SABR media requests from that same IP. The `client` package
mirrors these shapes and keeps the JSON tags in sync, so the fields below are
authoritative. Optional fields are marked. Errors use a JSON envelope, described
under [Errors](#errors).

### `POST /get_pot`

`content_binding` is the value the token binds to: a **video ID** for a player
token or **visitor data** for a GVS token, up to 4096 bytes. The optional `scope`
(`player`, `gvs`, `pot`, or omitted) only namespaces cache entries;
`content_binding` selects the token type. The response sets `X-Pot-Cache: hit`
when served from the cache or `miss` when freshly minted. A cache miss keeps a
fresh mint at least 12 seconds clear of the last context establishment on that
browser session, for the same grading reason described under `/player-context`
below, so a request that misses the cache just after any establishment on that
browser session, not only the startup proof, may wait up to that long.

```jsonc
// request
{"content_binding": "<video_id | visitor_data>", "scope": "player"}  // scope optional
// response
{
  "poToken": "MnRV...",
  "contentBinding": "<echoed content_binding>",
  "expiresAt": "2026-07-01T18:00:00Z",   // RFC3339; now+6h when the grant lifetime is unknown
  "warning": "content_binding looks like a URL; ..."  // optional; only when the binding looks like a URL
}
```

### `GET`, `POST /player-context`

`POST /player-context {"video_id":"<id>"}` or `GET /player-context?video_id=<id>`
returns the browser's streaming context. Select each `audio_formats` entry by its
full `(itag, lmt, xtags)` tuple, never by `itag` alone: a clean track and a DRC
track can share `itag` 251 and differ only in `xtags`, and an inconsistent tuple
makes the SABR server return a player-response reload instead of media.
`playability_status` is YouTube's string status (such as `"OK"`), not the SABR
status-1 protection code embedded in the signed URL.

```jsonc
// response
{
  "playability_status": "OK",
  "player_url": "https://www.youtube.com/s/player/<hash>/player_ias.vflset/en_US/base.js",

      // Remaining fields as above. Select by the full tuple, never itag alone.
    }
  ],
  "session_generation": 1
}
```

Two things happen before the daemon serves a context. It proves full-length
streaming once per browser session, on the landing video or, if that one is
unavailable or too short, a fallback candidate, because a context that is the
session's first playback is graded as a preview about as often as not. A session
that cannot prove it is refused rather than served, and a failed proof is not
retried on every request: it refuses immediately for the next 30 seconds without
another attempt, and if the proof still fails once that cool-down has passed, the
session is relaunched once and the fresh session is proved in its place, refusing
only if that also fails. The refusal arrives as the `player-context-failed` error
(502) and is safe to retry once the cool-down passes, so a consumer does not need
to treat it as a problem with the video. It also keeps the served context at
least 12 seconds away from the last token mint or proof playback on that browser
session, and keeps a token mint the same distance from the last establishment,
because a context taken within a few seconds of either is graded the same way.
Contexts served earlier do not extend that window, so back-to-back requests are
not delayed by one another. The first context after startup or a relaunch may
wait for both steps; later requests normally find the session proved and the
window already clear. A context that clears both steps is then served without
any further, per-request check: the daemon removes the measured cause of a
graded preview and refuses when it cannot prove the session, but it does not
itself grade the URL it hands out. The startup self-test performs the proof
before the daemon accepts traffic. `WAXSEAL_MINT_SEPARATION` overrides the
spacing with any positive Go duration, for example `20s`.

A bot check ("Sign in to confirm you're not a bot") describes the browser
session, not the video, so it is never answered as `video-unavailable` and the
video is never negative-cached. The wall keys on the visitor identity, and the
only thing that lifts it is a fresh one: the daemon relaunches once per 10
minutes on a bot check and serves the request from the replacement, which is the
common case. A check on the replacement, or one inside that window, is refused as
`player-context-failed` (502) with a 2 minute `Retry-After`.

### `GET /session`

Exports the guest identity for the session-adoption path (`--session-url` plus
`--potoken-url`), after verifying full-length streaming with the same cool-down
and one-relaunch-per-streak policy described under `/player-context`, including
its bot-check relaunch. No request
body, and no Google login. If the startup self-test already proved the session
this call is immediate; if it did not, this call performs the proof itself, and
unlike a served context it is not held back by the mint-separation window, since
`/session` hands out the identity itself rather than a context tied to a recent
mint. A session that cannot prove full-length streaming is refused as
`no-session` (503) rather than exported.

```jsonc
// response
{
  "visitor_data": "<base64>",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 ...",
  "client_version": "2.YYYYMMDD.NN.NN",
  "cookies": [
    {
      "name": "VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE",
      "value": "...",
      "domain": ".youtube.com",
      "path": "/",
      "secure": true,
      "http_only": true,
      "same_site": "None",               // optional: "Strict" | "Lax" | "None"; omitted when unset
      "expires": "2035-01-02T03:04:05Z"  // optional RFC3339; omitted for session cookies
    }
  ],
  "cookie_header": "VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE=...; YSC=...",
  "session_generation": 1
}
```

### `POST /report`

Report a degraded stream by the `session_generation` from `/session` or
`/player-context`. `session_generation` is required; optional `video_id` and
`reason` must be 1-64 characters from `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`. Reports are scoped and
rate-limited per tenant: report-driven recycles draw from a budget of 4 that
refills at one per `--report-debounce` (default `5m`). A report past the budget
is rejected with `retry_after_seconds` and a `Retry-After` header, and stale or
future generations are ignored.

```jsonc
// request
{"session_generation": 1, "video_id": "<id>", "reason": "truncated"}  // video_id, reason optional
// response
{
  "accepted": false,
  "retired": false,
  "retirement_pending": false,
  "generation": 1,
  "retry_after_seconds": 300   // optional; only when rate-limited
}
```

`/metrics` counts each report by disposition: `degradation_reports_accepted`
(applied to the live session), `degradation_reports_rate_limited` (past the
report budget), `degradation_reports_rejected_stale` (an old or replaced
generation), `degradation_reports_already_retired` (the current generation,
already retired by a crash or a prior report; a benign no-op), and
`degradation_reports_duplicate_pending` (a repeat report for a generation whose
retirement is already queued for the next streaming handoff).

### Authentication and tenants

The daemon is keyless and single-tenant by default. Pass `--tenant-keys` to run
isolated browser contexts keyed by API key:

```sh
go run ./cmd/waxseal server --tenant-keys "alice=KEYA,bob=KEYB"
curl -s localhost:4416/get_pot -H "X-API-Key: KEYA" -d '{"content_binding":"<id>"}'
```

Keys travel in `X-API-Key`, `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, or `?key=<key>`, and
are read in that order: the first source carrying a value wins, so a request may
present its key wherever is convenient. The `Bearer` scheme is matched case
insensitively, as RFC 7235 requires, and an `Authorization` header naming another
scheme or carrying no credentials falls through to `?key=` rather than resolving
to an empty key.

One consequence is worth naming for anyone upgrading: a `Bearer` header spelled
in any case now takes precedence over `?key=`, where previously only the exact
spelling `Bearer ` did. A deployment that sends a lowercase `authorization:
bearer` header for something other than WaxSeal, and relies on `?key=` for the
tenant key, has to move that key to `X-API-Key`, which outranks both.

Prefer a header. `?key=<key>` puts the key in the request line, which reverse
proxies and container runtimes write to their access logs, so a health check
polling every few seconds leaves the key in those logs for the life of the
deployment. `waxseal ping --key` and the `client` package both send the header.
A liveness check needs no key at all: a keyed daemon answers a keyless `/ping`
with the shared browser's health rather than `401` (see
[Operations](#operations)), which is what the image's `HEALTHCHECK` relies on.
An empty `--key` is a usage error rather than "no key", so a probe whose key
variable is unset fails loudly instead of quietly checking the browser alone.
`--tenant-keys` takes comma-separated `label=key` entries or bare keys (which get
generated labels); labels and keys must be non-empty and unique, and an invalid
set stops startup before Chromium launches. A keyless daemon on a non-loopback
host exposes its guest identity through `/session` and `/player-context`, so use
`--tenant-keys` when exposing the service.

### Metrics

`/metrics` reports operational counters and always returns HTTP 200; redaction is
a successful response, not a `401`. On a keyed daemon it is **redacted by
default** and unlocks only for the operator key or an explicit public flag:

| Daemon / request | `/metrics` returns |
|---|---|
| keyless (default) | full per-tenant detail |
| keyed, no key / tenant key / wrong key | redacted aggregate: daemon-wide summed counters, no labels, no tenant count |
| keyed, correct `--metrics-key` | full per-tenant detail |
| keyed, `--metrics-public` | full per-tenant detail, unauthenticated |

Tenant keys never unlock detail; only `--metrics-key` (which must differ from
every tenant key) or `--metrics-public` does, keeping minting keys separate from
metrics access. When both are set, `--metrics-public` wins. Both are ignored on a
keyless daemon.

The full view is `{"tenants":N,"per_tenant":{"<label>":{...}},...}` plus the
two daemon-wide browser counters below, each tenant object carrying lifetime
counters (`mints`, `crashes`, `player_contexts`,
`separation_waits` for requests held back to keep a mint and an establishment
apart, `unproven_rejections` for contexts refused because the session could not
prove full-length streaming, the five `degradation_reports_*` dispositions above,
and so on) plus current state.

These counters are worth knowing exactly:

- `player_context_failures` counts real failed attempts against the browser and
  nothing else.
- `player_context_negative_cache_hits` counts requests refused from the
  negative cache without touching the browser. They are counted apart because one
  caller looping on a single unplayable video can drive this by six orders of
  magnitude while every real request succeeds, which would bury the failure rate.
- `bot_checks` counts each bot check the browser answered, at a proof or at a
  context. The refusal that follows a bot-check cool-down counts under
  `unproven_rejections`, as a proof cool-down's does.
- `probe_failures` counts the sessions a tenant-level `/ping` confirmed
  unresponsive and retired, one per session. `crashes` also counts CDP-event
  deaths, so the two together separate probe-detected loss from the rest. A
  browser the probe tears down (below) retires every tenant's session on it,
  which each tenant counts as a crash: the sessions were already unusable on a
  wedged browser, and the teardown is what lets them come back.
- `probe_busy` counts the tenant probes that confirmed a page failure but found
  the page held by a request, so nothing was retired at the session level. It is
  benign, which is exactly why it is counted: without this, a daemon answering
  `busy` on every probe looks the same as a healthy one. The browser check that
  follows such a probe can still find the browser itself wedged, in which case
  the response reads `probe-failed` while this counter has moved.
- `browser_probe_failures` counts the browsers a `/ping` confirmed unresponsive
  and tore down, whether the daemon-level probe found it or a tenant-level probe
  escalated to it, one per browser lost rather than one per probe.
- `browser_relaunch_failures` counts the relaunch attempts, from a probe or a
  request, whose launch failed. Together with a failing probe it says the daemon
  has no browser and cannot get one. Both browser counters describe the shared
  Chromium, not a tenant, so they sit at the top level of both views instead of
  among the summed counters.
- `cache_entries` reports **servable** entries: current generation, not yet
  expired, which is what a token request would actually be served from. A
  consumer degradation report drops that generation's cached tokens, so it takes
  `cache_entries` for the tenant to 0.

Detail fields are always present so the schema stays stable across retirement,
crash, and recycle; a field that does not apply is `null` or `""` rather than
omitted. For example `last_browser_proof_age_secs` is `null` until the first
proof, which reserves `0` for "just proved", and
`streaming_seconds_until_recycle` appears only when time-based recycling is
enabled (`--streaming-max-age` > 0). The redacted view is
`{"redacted":true,"aggregate":{...},...}`: the same counters summed across
tenants, with no labels and no tenant count, plus the two daemon-wide browser
counters at top level.

### Errors

Recognized endpoints and unknown paths return
`{"error":"<message>","code":"<machine-readable-code>"}`. `video-unavailable`
adds a `details` field with the playability status. `/ping` health bodies do
not use this envelope; they report health directly (see
[Operations](#operations)). Only its `400` and `401` rejections do.

A refusal the daemon expects to lift on its own also sends `Retry-After` and
`retry_after_seconds` with the remaining wait: `player-context-failed` and
`no-session` during a cool-down after a failed proof or a bot check, and
`mint-failed`, `player-context-failed`, or `no-session` while the shared
browser's relaunch is backing off. A 502 without them is worth one quick retry;
a 422 is not.

| Code | HTTP | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| `invalid-request` | 400 | Malformed or invalid input |
| `unauthorized` | 401 | Missing or invalid API key |
| `not-found` | 404 | Unknown path or endpoint |
| `method-not-allowed` | 405 | Unsupported HTTP method |
| `video-unavailable` | 422 | Terminal playability status |
| `mint-failed`, `player-context-failed` | 502 | Upstream operation failed; may carry `retry_after_seconds` |
| `no-session` | 503 | No attested session is available; may carry `retry_after_seconds` |
| `timeout` | 504 | Deadline elapsed for `/get_pot`, `/player-context`, or `/session` |

Two cases skip the envelope, both handled by `http.ServeMux` before any WaxSeal
handler runs. A non-canonical path (with `.`, `..`, or repeated slashes, such as
`//get_pot`) gets a **307** redirect to its cleaned form with the short
`text/html` or empty body that `http.Redirect` produces, so a client that does
not follow redirects must not expect JSON there. A trailing slash is a distinct
path, so `/get_pot/` returns the structured **404**.

`/report` decodes strictly: an unknown field, often a typo such as `raeson` for
`reason`, is rejected with **400 `invalid-request`** naming the key, since its
optional fields would otherwise be dropped silently. `/get_pot` and
`/player-context` stay lenient and ignore unknown fields, because `/get_pot` must
tolerate the extra fields a generic yt-dlp client sends (`proxy`, `bypass_cache`,
`source_address`) and `/player-context` reads `video_id` from the body or the
query string. Duplicate keys are lenient everywhere, since `encoding/json` keeps
the last value. The `client` package parses these into `*client.APIError` with
matching code constants.

## Operations

One Chromium process hosts an isolated incognito context per tenant; additional
tenants attest on their first token, player-context, or session request.

WaxSeal launches Chromium over a CDP pipe. On normal teardown it terminates
Chromium's process group and removes the profile, and a clean exit also lets
Chromium read EOF on the closed pipe and quit. If the daemon dies without
teardown (SIGKILL, OOM), a browser may linger briefly; the next startup removes
abandoned WaxSeal profile directories it can prove are unused, without scanning or
killing processes, and Chromium generally exits once its profile is gone.
Profiles live under `$HOME` so snap-confined Chromium can open them and so shared
hosts keep each daemon's profiles private.

The `crashes` metric counts unexpected browser loss from Chromium events or a
failed health probe, not retirement from age, a report, or operation retries. A
probe failure is confirmed by a second probe before the session is retired, so a
single transient CDP hiccup no longer destroys a warm generation; only the
confirmed loss counts. `probe_failures` is the probe-only view of the same
events.
`--report-debounce` (default `5m`) throttles all report-driven recycles for a
tenant across generations, not just repeats of one generation. Bursts of up to 4
recycles are allowed before the limit bites, enough for a consumer whose
bulk-enumeration throttle escape rotates its identity several times in quick
succession; past the burst, the budget refills at one recycle per interval. This
is deliberate anti-storm behavior; workloads that recycle faster on a sustained
basis may lower it.

Health checks use `/ping`. With a tenant key, or on a keyless daemon where the
empty key selects the one tenant, it probes that tenant's session and returns
HTTP 200 with `ok:true` or `ok:false`, `probe:"tenant"`, and an always-present
`reason`: `ok`, `no-session` (benign, since a `POST /report` retires the session
and re-establishment is lazy, so `ok` briefly reads `false`), `busy` (benign: a
probe failed twice but a request held the page, so nothing was retired and the
next probe re-checks once that request finishes), or `probe-failed` (this probe
confirmed a loss, logged at `warn`).

Whenever no page answered, the daemon also checks the shared Chromium, because
a wedged browser looks the same from a retired page, a page in use, or no page
at all, and the next request would otherwise stall on it for its whole budget
before the pool noticed. A browser that answers leaves the tenant reason
standing. One that had exited is relaunched on the spot, the tenant reason
stands, and the body says `browser_relaunched:true`. One that misses two probes
is torn down and replaced, counted in `browser_probe_failures`, and reported as
`probe-failed` with the browser's error after the tenant's, since the loss is
the probe's finding even though it was remedied. One that cannot be replaced is
`probe-failed` too, with the launch error. A page that answered has already
proved the browser, so a healthy probe costs one round trip.

On a keyed daemon, a `/ping` that presents no key is answered at daemon scope
instead of with `401`. The body says `probe:"daemon"` and carries only `ok`,
`reason`, `browser_relaunched`, and on failure `error`: the browser check above
on its own, with `ok` meaning a running Chromium answered, possibly after a
relaunch. That is less than the redacted `/metrics` already serves anyone,
which is why the probe needs neither a key nor a loopback source: an
orchestrator's probe arrives from the node, and a port published through
Docker's proxy arrives from the bridge address, so the source says nothing
about who is asking. A caller cannot make a healthy browser fail the check, so
the teardown and relaunch it can lead to happen only to a browser that is
wedged or gone, and the pool single-flights and backs off relaunches on its
own. A key that is present but wrong is still `401`, so a typo in a probe's
`--key` fails the probe instead of quietly downgrading it to the daemon-level
answer.

Alert only on `probe-failed`; a caller that disconnects mid-probe is not counted
as one. For status-code-only checks (k8s, `curl -f`, HAProxy), `?strict=true`
maps `probe-failed` to **503** while `no-session`, `busy`, and healthy stay
**200**, and `waxseal ping --strict` does the same from the CLI, so liveness
probes do not fail during the benign re-establishment window. A bare `?strict`
also enables it; a value `strconv.ParseBool` cannot read (`yes`, `on`, `banana`)
returns **400** rather than quietly running non-strict, so a typo in a probe is
visible. Size a probe's timeout for the worst case: up to four session round
trips and a session teardown, two browser round trips and a browser teardown,
each bounded at 5 seconds, plus a relaunch, which normally takes a second or two
and is bounded by the 60 second launch handshake; the image's `HEALTHCHECK`
allows 110. The image runs `waxseal ping --strict` with no key, which checks
the browser on a keyed daemon and the one tenant's session plus the browser on
a keyless one, and it keeps working once the daemon is keyed. Add `--key <key>`
to also probe that tenant's session; the CLI sends the key as a header and keeps
it out of access logs.

Headless Chromium reports a `HeadlessChrome` token in `navigator.userAgent` and
in its brand list, so WaxSeal installs a user-agent override that substitutes
`Chrome` for it. Everything else in that override is the browser's own
`navigator.userAgentData`, read back from a page WaxSeal serves to itself on
loopback (the API is exposed only in a secure context, and the `about:blank` the
override has to be installed on is not one). That keeps the randomised GREASE
brand, the four-part build version, and the real platform, architecture, and
bitness, all of which a fabricated block gets wrong in stable and inspectable
ways. `WAXSEAL_UA_HINTS=synthetic` restores the fabricated block if the real one
ever grades worse; `real` is the default and any other value is ignored with a
warning. Note that a Debian `chromium` build, which the image runs, reports no
`Google Chrome` brand at all while its user agent still says `Chrome/<version>`.
That is what real Debian Chromium looks like, not a bug.

WaxSeal is meant for loopback or a trusted network and does not implement CORS;
because it mints tokens, browser-origin access is out of scope. Run
`go run ./cmd/waxseal server --help` for the rest: session recycling, report
debounce, bind address, headful mode, and metrics access.

## Development

```sh
go test ./...                              # offline unit tests; no browser or network
(cd provider && go test ./...)             # the nested module's offline tests
go test -tags live ./internal/cdp          # real-Chromium CDP pipe-transport tests
(cd provider && go test -tags e2e ./...)   # provider network e2e; needs WAXSEAL_URL/WAXSEAL_KEY
make vet                                   # what CI vets: both modules, plus a windows cross-vet
make test                                  # both modules' offline tests, race-enabled
make live                                  # the live CDP tests above
make tidy-check                            # fail if go mod tidy would change either module
make vulncheck                             # govulncheck over both modules
make deps                                  # install browser-bundle build dependencies
make jsbundle-browser                      # regenerate internal/browser/bg_browser_bundle.js
```

`go test ./...` is fully offline and deterministic: no browser, no network. It
does not reach `provider/`, which is a separate module, so that module's own
offline tests (also pure `httptest`) need the second line; `make test` runs both.
The committed browser bundle means normal builds do not need Node. The live CDP
tests self-skip when no browser is found (`WAXSEAL_CHROME_BIN` picks one,
`WAXSEAL_REQUIRE_CHROME=1` fails instead of skipping, which CI sets). The `e2e`
tests live in the nested `provider/` module and must run from that directory,
since a root-level `go test -tags e2e ./...` silently descends into nothing; they
need a warm daemon and include the full-length WEB SABR download
(`go test -tags e2e -run PlayerContextOnlyFullLength ./...`). Set
`WAXSEAL_E2E_LOG_LEVEL=debug` to see the in-process daemon's debug logs in
`go test -v` output for that suite. `TestAgingMatrix` is a separate, opt-in
measurement of how an artifact's age affects a capped stream, not a regression
test: it skips unless `WAXSEAL_E2E_AGING=1` (which artifact's age predicts a
truncated stream), `=2` (how much separation between a mint and a served context
is enough), or `=3` (the same question for the distance between the proof
playback and the served context) is set, runs for tens of minutes, and only ever
reports a tally, never a pass/fail on truncation. `WAXSEAL_E2E_AGING_N` overrides the
per-arm iteration count (default 6) and `WAXSEAL_E2E_AGING_DELAY` overrides the
run-wide delay between warming and streaming (default `30s`; an arm carrying its
own delay ignores it). By default every in-process daemon the suite starts keeps
its own mint-to-establishment gate (12s unless `WAXSEAL_MINT_SEPARATION`
overrides it), so a default run is really a regression check: every arm is
expected to stream full length. `WAXSEAL_E2E_AGING_SEPARATION` (a Go duration
such as `1ms`) overrides that gate on those daemons so the arms measure raw gaps
again, the way the matrix originally separated them; because attestation always
pre-mints a token, the token age arms then measure time since attestation rather
than since their own mint call, which usually just returns that cached token.
`=3` refuses `WAXSEAL_E2E_AGING_SEPARATION` instead of honouring it: every arm of
that matrix sets the gate to its own gap, which is what holds the served context
exactly that far past the proof, so the gate is the measuring instrument rather
than something to remove. Each of its records carries an `anchor=` column read
out of the daemon's own log, so a run proves per iteration that it waited on the
proof and not on a mint.
The `client` package is a reusable, consumer-agnostic HTTP client; the
`provider/` module adapts it to the token-provider interface a streaming
consumer expects.

CLI exit codes: `0` success, `1` runtime failure, `2` usage error, `3` unavailable
video, `130` interruption. A bot check is a runtime failure (`1`), not an
unavailable video: it describes the browser session rather than the video.

Some coverage stays out of `go test ./...` because it needs a display or a long
run: **headful mode** (`go run ./cmd/waxseal server --headful`) to watch a real
session, a **time-based recycling soak** (a short `--streaming-max-age` with
continuous streaming to watch `streaming_seconds_until_recycle`), and a
**cache-exhaustion loop** (`POST /get_pot` 1000+ times with distinct
`content_binding` values to exercise cache eviction).

Work cut from a change is tracked in [docs/deferred-work.md](docs/deferred-work.md),
and what WaxSeal wants from the sibling repos it depends on in
[docs/upstream-requests.md](docs/upstream-requests.md).

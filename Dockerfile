# WaxSeal is a real-browser PO-token service. The image includes Chromium and
# drives it through the Chrome DevTools Protocol. Chromium runs with
# --no-sandbox inside the container, so the container boundary provides the
# isolation. The image uses a non-root user, and the compose files drop
# capabilities and disable privilege escalation.

FROM debian:trixie-slim
# Chromium renders WebGL with its own bundled SwiftShader because --disable-gpu is
# set (unconditional in internal/cdp/launch.go), so the Mesa/LLVM stack chromium
# pulls in is never loaded. Purging it drops 272 MB, and the dangling dlopen
# targets it leaves behind have no runtime effect.
#
# The assertion guards the list, which is release specific (bookworm had
# libllvm15, no mesa-libgallium) and fails silently: dpkg --purge exits 0 with a
# warning for a package that is not installed. The globs catch a rename that
# leaves its files, dpkg-query catches a package in any state short of
# not-installed, such as a remove that left a config record. If a build trips
# either, fix the list rather than the assertion.

# the shared browser's health, relaunching a browser that has exited, so this
# works unchanged once the daemon is keyed. Add `--key <key>` to also probe that
# tenant's session; the browser is checked either way.

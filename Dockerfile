# WaxSeal is a real-browser PO-token service. The image includes Chromium and
# drives it through the Chrome DevTools Protocol. Chromium runs with
# --no-sandbox inside the container, so the container boundary provides the
# isolation. The image uses a non-root user, and the compose files drop
# capabilities and disable privilege escalation.

# WaxSeal build orchestration.
#
# WaxSeal mints YouTube PO tokens from a real headless Chromium, driven through
# the Chrome DevTools Protocol by internal/cdp.
# Node and esbuild produce the browser bundle embedded in internal/browser. The
# bundle is committed, so `go build` and `go test` do not need Node. The CLI and
# daemon still require Chromium at runtime.

# VERSION stamps binaries and tags images. A leading v is dropped so a git tag
# can be passed as is: v1.2.3 stamps and tags 1.2.3. override reaches a value
# given on the command line, which a plain assignment would leave alone.
